# Problem 1

`problem1` is a rust library with one broken function: `find_largest_element`

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to fix the code so that it will actually find the largest
element in the given `Vector` (which is similar to lists or arrays in other languages).

Run tests with: `cargo test --all` or `cargo test --package problem1`
